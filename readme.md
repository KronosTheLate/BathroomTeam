This is a repository for the group known as "Bathroom Team" to collaborate on programming projects and tasks.
When creating files, place them in the right folder as indicated by the names of the folders. The filename should start with your name, capitalized, followed by an underscore and the lecture number. What comes after is up to you. Example:
```ComputationalPhysics/Homework/Dennis_1_whatIlike_from here.jl```
