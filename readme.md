## File naming convension
When creating files, place them in the right folder as indicated by the names of the folders. The filename should 
1. Start with your name (capitalized).
2. Follow up name by an underscore and the lecture number.

What comes after is up to you. Example:  
```ComputationalPhysics/Homework/Dennis_1whatIlike_from here.jl```

## Markdown
If you also want to make fancy content in this Markdown readme file, a good starting point is [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) from `docs-github-com`.  
A nice tip is to finnish a line with two spaces before a new line to respect the linebreak in the rendered document.
